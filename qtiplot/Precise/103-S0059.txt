function zeros indicating most effectively phase transitions
and critical phenomena, and to perform microcanonical
analysis of phase transitions and critical phenomena, we need
to calculate the density of states. Currently, Wang-Landau
Monte Carlo algorithm [3] is one of the most efficient Monte
Carlo methods to calculate the approximate density of states.
In Wang-Landau Monte Carlo algorithm, the inverse of the
density of states is employed as the sampling probability
function, and the real values for the density of states can be
obtained quickly due to its modification factor.
Phase transitions and critical phenomena can also be
understood based on the concept of partition function zeros.
Fisher introduced the partition function zeros in the complex
temperature plane utilizing the Onsager solution of the
square-lattice Ising model in the absence of an external
magnetic field [4]. Fisher also showed that the partition
function zeros in the complex temperature plane of the
square-lattice Ising model determine its ferromagnetic and
antiferromagnetic critical temperatures at the same time in
the absence an external magnetic field. By calculating the
partition function zeros and examining the behavior of the
first partition function zero (partition function zero closest to
the positive real axis) in the thermodynamic limit, phase
transitions and critical phenomena can be much more
accurately analyzed than examining the behavior of the
specific heat per volume for real values of the temperature,
which is plagued by the noise due to the subleading terms
containing zeros other than the first ones [5−20].
In the next section, the density of states and the partition
function of the square-lattice Ising model are defined. In
Section III, Wang-Landau Monte Carlo algorithm to
calculate the approximate density of states is briefly
explained. In Section IV, the concept of the partition function
zeros in the complex temperature plane is introduced, the
partition function zeros of the square-lattice Ising model are
evaluated in the complex temperature plane using the exact
density of states and the approximate density of states, and
both results are compared.

Abstract—Phase transitions and critical phenomena are the
most universal phenomena in nature. To understand the phase
transitions and critical phenomena of a given system as a
continuous function of temperature and to obtain the partition
function zeros in the complex temperature plane indicating
most effectively phase transitions and critical phenomena, we
need to calculate the density of states. Currently, Wang-Landau
Monte Carlo algorithm is one of the most efficient Monte Carlo
methods to calculate the approximate density of states. Using
Wang-Landau Monte Carlo algorithm, the density of states for
the Ising model on L x L square lattices (L = 4 ~ 32) with periodic
boundary conditions is obtained, and the partition function
zeros of the Ising model are evaluated in the complex
temperature plane. By examining the behavior of the first
partition function zero (partition function zero closest to the
positive real axis), phase transitions and critical phenomena can
be much more accurately analyzed. The approximate first zeros
of the Ising ferromagnet, obtained from Wang-Landau
algorithm, are quite close to the exact ones, indicating that it is a
reliable method for calculating the density of states and the first
partition function zeros.

I. INTRODUCTION
Phase transitions and critical phenomena are the most
universal phenomena in nature. The two-dimensional Ising
model is the simplest system showing phase transitions and
critical phenomena at finite temperatures. Since the Onsager
(Nobel prize winner in 1968) solution [1] of the square-lattice
Ising model with periodic boundary conditions in the absence
an external magnetic field, the two-dimensional Ising model
has played a central role in our understanding of phase
transitions and critical phenomena [2].
To understand phase transitions and critical phenomena,
various theoretical methods (such as mean-field theory,
power-series expansion and analysis, renormalization group,
and transfer matrix) have been developed. Recently,
computer simulations, in particular, Monte Carlo computer
simulations have been the most popular method in studying
phase transitions and critical phenomena. To understand the
phase transition and critical phenomena of a given system as
a continuous function of temperature, to obtain the partition

One of the most important methods in studying phase
transitions and critical phenomena is computer simulation, in
particular, Monte Carlo computer simulation. The
importance sampling Monte Carlo method, Metropolis Mote
Carlo algorithm [21], has been used extensively in science
and engineering. In Metropolis Mote Carlo algorithm, the
natural canonical distribution function,
exp( − β H ),

(11)

where H is the Hamiltonian of a given system, is employed as
the sampling probability function at a given temperature T.
The canonical distribution function can be written as
Ω ( E ) exp( − β E ),

(12)

as a function of energy E, where Ω ( E ) is the density of
states and exp( − β E ) is the Boltzmann-Gibbs factor. As
energy E increases, the density of states increases sharply and
the Boltzmann-Gibbs factor decreases sharply. Therefore, the
canonical distribution function is a needle-shaped function
around ET, which becomes the delta function in the
thermodynamic limit.
Metropolis Mote Carlo algorithm is the most efficient
method for understanding the properties of a given system at
a fixed temperature. However, if we want to understand the
phase transitions and critical phenomena of a given system as
a continuous function of temperature, to obtain the partition
function zeros in the complex temperature plane indicating
most effectively phase transitions and critical phenomena,
and to perform microcanonical analysis of phase transitions
and critical phenomena, Metropolis Mote Carlo algorithm is
not useful. To understand the transition properties of a given
system as a continuous function of temperature, to obtain the
partition function zeros, and to perform microcanonical
analysis, we need to calculate the density of states. Currently,
Wang-Landau Monte Carlo algorithm is one of the most
efficient Monte Carlo methods to calculate the approximate
density of states [3].
In Wang-Landau Monte Carlo algorithm, the reciprocal of
the density of states, 1 / Ω ( E ) , is also employed as the
sampling probability function. That is, the transition
probability from a state with energy E1 to another state with
energy E2 is defined by
p ( E1 → E 2 ) = min[ Ω ( E1 ) / Ω ( E 2 ),1],

(13)

where E1 and E2 are energies before and after a random spin
flip. Because this definition means a random walk in energy
space with a probability proportional to the reciprocal of the
density of states, 1 / Ω ( E ) , a truly flat histogram for the
energy distribution can be obtained after an infinite number
of random Monte Carlo moves.
The density of states is a priori unknown. Therefore, at the
first time, we generate a crude version of the density of states,
2

Ω 0 ( E ) , by accepting all L × 10 Monte Carlo steps. Now,

IV. PARTITION FUNCTION ZEROS

the initial density of states Ω 0 ( E ) is employed as the
sampling probability function, and then the density of states
is changed after a Monte Carlo step. Each Monte Carlo step,
the density of states is updated according to the following
rule
Ω ( E ) → f Ω ( E ),

In the thermodynamic limit, the specific heat (per volume)
of the square-lattice Ising ferromagnet becomes infinite at the
critical temperature where the transition between the
paramagnetic phase and the ferromagnetic phase emerges. In
finite systems, the specific heat per volume shows a sharp
peak but is not infinite. At the same time, the location (the
so-called effective critical temperature) of the sharp peak of
the specific heat in a finite system is different from the critical
temperature at the inifinite system. As the system size
increases, the effective critical temperature approaches the
critical temperature.
Given the density of states Ω ( E ) , the free energy (per
volume) of the square-lattice Ising model is given by

(14)

where f ( > 1) is the modification factor [3]. Owing to this
factor, an improved version of the density of states can be
obtained quickly. At the first time, the modification factor is
conveniently chosen as
f 1 = e.

(15)

f ( y ) = − ( k B TL− 2 ) ln Z ( y )

During a finite number of Monte Carlo steps with f1, the
initial density of states Ω 0 ( E ) evolves into the new density

2 L2

= − ( k B TL− 2 )[2 β JL2 + ln ∑ Ω ( E ) y E ].
E =0

of states Ω 1 ( E ) . Next, the modification factor is reduced
according to the following rule
fi =

f i −1 .

Therefore, the specific heat (per volume) is expressed as
(16)

C ( y ) = ( k B T 2 L2 ) − 1

Therefore, during a finite number of Monte Carlo steps with
f 2 = exp(1 / 2),

∂2
ln Z ( y )
∂β 2

(20)

= ( k B L−2 )(ln y ) 2 ( < E 2 > − < E > 2 ).

(17)

In the thermodynamic limit, the specific heat (per volume) of
the square-lattice Ising ferromagnet diverges at the critical
temperature

the density of states Ω 1 ( E ) evolves into Ω 2 ( E ) . If we
repeat these processes thirty times, we have the final
modification factor
f 30 = exp(2 −29 ) = 1.00000000186,

The ordered ferromagnetic phase appears below yc, whereas
the disordered paramagnetic phase appears above yc. The
properties of the phase transition of the Ising model are
completely equivalent to those of the gas-liquid phase
transition for a simple system [22, 23].
Phase transitions and critical phenomena can also be
understood based on the concept of partition function zeros.
Yang and Lee (Nobel prize winners in 1957) proposed a
rigorous mechanism for the occurrence of phase transitions in
the thermodynamic limit and yielded an insight into the
unsolved problem of the ferromagnetic Ising model at
arbitrary temperature (T) in an external magnetic field (B) by
introducing the concept of the zeros of the partition function
Z(T,B) in the complex magnetic-field plane [22]. They also
formulated the celebrated circle theorem, which states that
the partition function zeros of the Ising ferromagnet lie on the
unit circle in the complex fugacity plane [23].
Following Yang and Lee's idea, Fisher introduced the
partition function zeros in the complex temperature plane
utilizing the Onsager solution of the square-lattice Ising
model in the absence of an external magnetic field [4]. Fisher
also showed that the partition function zeros in the complex
temperature plane of the square-lattice Ising model determine
its ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic critical temperatures
at the same time for B = 0. In finite systems no zero cut the

and reach an accurate version of density of states Ω 30 ( E ) ,
quite close to the true density of states, for example, the exact
integer values in Table I.
Every L2 × 10 6 Monte Carlo steps, we check the flatness
of the energy histogram distribution hi ( E ) . If the maximum
histogram value is less than 1.2 times the average value of
histogram < hi ( E ) > and the minimum histogram value is
larger than 0.8 < hi ( E ) > (the so-called 20% flatness
criterion), we reduce the modification factor from fi to fi+1,
and reset the histogram to zero. If not, we repeat L2 × 10 6
Monte Carlo steps again and again until the 20% flatness
criterion is satisfied without changing the value of the
modification factor.
Table II shows the approximate values for the density of
states of the Ising model on the 8 × 8 square lattice with
periodic boundary conditions, obtained from Wang-Landau
Monte Carlo algorithm. As shown in the table, the
approximate values are quite close to the exact integer ones in
Table I.

positive real axis in the complex temperature plane, but some
zeros for a system showing a phase transition approach the
positive real axis as the system size increases, determining
the critical temperature and the related critical exponents in
the thermodynamic limit.
Since the properties of the partition function zeros of a
given system provided the valuable information on its exact
solution, the earlier studies on partition function zeros were
mainly performed in the fields of mathematics and
mathematical physics. Nowadays, the concept of partition
function zeros is applied to all fields of science from
elementary particle physics to protein folding, and they are
used as one of the most effective methods to determine the
critical temperatures and exponents [5−20].
The partition function Z ( y ) of the square-lattice Ising
model can be expressed as its zeros {yi} in the complex
temperature (y) plane:

Z ( y ) = exp(2 β JL ) ∑ Ω ( E ) y = A ∏ ( y − y i ),

Using the Onsager solution of the square-lattice Ising
ferromagnet with periodic boundary conditions, we can
obtain the exact partition function zeros of the square-lattice
Ising model in the complex y plane. Among the partition
function zeros, the first zero (y1) is most important because it
determines the critical temperature and the critical exponents.
Table III shows the exact first zeros y1(L) of the Ising
ferromagnet on L x L square lattices (L = 4 ~ 32) with periodic
boundary conditions. As shown in the table, as the system
size L increases, the real part of the first zero Re[y1(L)]
approaches the exact critical temperature yc = −1 + √2
following the finite-size scaling law

Also, the imaginary part of the first zero Im[y1(L)] decreases
quickly following the similar finite-size scaling law

i =1

2 L2

f ( y ) = − ( k B TL− 2 )[ln A + ∑ ln( y − y i )],

However, it is impossible to calculate the partition
function zeros by using popular Metropolis Monte Carlo
computer simulations. That is why the concept of the
partition function zeros has not been used popularly and
extensively in science and engineering. Now, with new
Wang-Landau Monte Carlo computer simulations, it is
possible to calculate the partition function zeros. We have
calculated the partition function zeros of the square-lattice
Ising ferromagnet with periodic boundary conditions from
the density of states Ω ( E ) , generated by Wang-Landau
Monte Carlo computer simulations with the 20 % flatness
criterion for histograms. We have used one core of a Linux
PC with one Intel i7-2600K CPU for Wang-Landau Monte
Carlo computer simulations. The CPU time for the Ising
model on 10 x 10 square lattice is just 3 minutes and 19
seconds. Also, the CPU time is 14 minutes and 8 seconds on
20 x 20 square lattice, and 48 minutes and 26 seconds on 32 x
32 square lattice. Therefore, Wang-Landau Monte Carlo
algorithm is quite fast with a modern computer.

For a system with the phase transition at the critical
temperature yc, the loci of the partition function zeros close in
toward the real axis to intersect it in the thermodynamic limit,
and the singularity of the specific heat (per volume) C(y)
appears in this limit. It is clear from C(y) that the leading
behavior of such a singularity is due to the pair of partition
function zeros closest to the positive real axis, called the first
zeros (y1). Therefore, by calculating the partition function
zeros and examining the behavior of the first zero in the
thermodynamic limit, the critical behavior can be much more
accurately analyzed than examining the behavior of the
specific heat per volume for real values of the temperature,
which is plagued by the noise due to the subleading terms
containing zeros other than the first ones.

Table IV shows the approximate first zeros y1(L) of the
Ising ferromagnet on L x L square lattices (L = 4 ~ 32) with
periodic boundary conditions, obtained from Wang-Landau
Monte Carlo computer simulations. As shown in the table,
the approximate first zeros are quite close to the exact ones in
Table III.

Table V shows the errors (%) of the approximate first
zeros from the exact ones. The second column of the table
shows the error of the real part of the approximate first zero
from the exact one, and the errors are less than 0.06%. The
third column shows the error for the difference, as in (25),
between the real part and the critical temperature, and the
errors are less than 4.0%. The fourth column of Table V
shows the error of the imaginary part of the approximate first
zero from the exact one, and the errors are less than 0.64%.
Overally, the errors are quite small, indicating that
Wang-Landau Monte Carlo algorithm is a reliable method for
calculating the density of states and the first partition
function zeros.
